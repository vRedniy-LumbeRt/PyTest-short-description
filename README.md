# PyTest-short-description
In this repo I show main features of PyTest

Main informaition about PyTest features can be found in ```PyTest.md```.

File ```Launch_example.md``` describes launching test from your console (files ```try_pytest_features.py``` and  directory ```tests_dir``` are used for demonstration).
